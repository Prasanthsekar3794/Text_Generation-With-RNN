# Text_Generation-With-RNNs

**Project Title:**

Text Generation with RNNs

**Introduction:**

This project demonstrates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for generating text sequences. The RNN model is trained on a dataset of text sequences to learn the patterns and structures of the input data, enabling it to generate new text sequences that closely resemble the training data.

**Getting Started**

To run the project, you'll need Python and TensorFlow installed. You can install TensorFlow using pip:

pip install tensorflow

**Usage**

You can train the RNN model using the provided dataset by running the train.py script:
python train.py

Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate text sequences by running the generate.py script:
python generate.py

**Future Enhancements**

Incorporate attention mechanisms to improve the model's performance.

Explore transformer architectures for further improvements in text generation quality.

Fine-tune the model on specific domains or datasets for domain-specific text generation tasks.
